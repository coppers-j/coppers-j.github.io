This is just a precursor post outlining an upcoming series of posts about Machine Learning. The posts are not only intended as an introduction to the topic for beginners but also as a reference for those who may already have experience (i.e. myself).

Topics covered will include:
* Mathematics Foundations for Machine Learning
* Data and Statistics
* Probability
* Information theory
* Neural Networks (MLP's and CNNs)
* Deep Learning
* Many more...

The aim of this series of posts is to not only (hopefully!) provide some useful introductory material for those looking to learn but to also reinforce my own understanding of the subject matter.
