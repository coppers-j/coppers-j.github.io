During year 11 and year 12 I was fortunate enough that my school, Ormiston College, decided to incorporate matlab into the mathematics curriculum. This gave me a head start with learning how to use MATLAB. Having had experience with programming previously, I learnt how to use matlab rather quickly. Initially using it for maths B and maths C for projects such as creating a model of income inequality in developing countries using a gini index and different mathematical methods to display the GDP distribution across a population.

After having experience with MATLAB in my mathematics subjects I, along with another student, developed a MATLAB program to read the input from a XV11 LIDAR sensor and output the visualisation of a room map. Furthermore we programmed some point of interest/object detection and used these to implement a primitive 2D SLAM algorithm. The program was intended to run on a raspberry pi to be used on a autonomous RC car, however was only ever functional on a laptop due to time constraints.

The Mathwork's project which I and 3 other students (Alexander Muirhead, Joshua Burton and Michael Poole) from Ormiston College worked on was the development of teaching aids for year 11 and 12 Maths B & C to be used in their assignments. The part that we all collaborated on was a quadratic visualisation tool using MATLAB's GUIDE, and was used to display simple polynomials on a cartesian plane and show the turning points/points of interests. The tool was intended to be used for students to check their work and reinforce the content taught in class. The second part of the project I worked on by myself was a MATLAB script that produced a Sierpinski's Triangle up to the input number of iterations, he script was intended for Maths C students to see the limits of some computational models as after 10 iterations. With the number of triangles increasing exponentially the students were tasked with finding a mathematical model to calculate the amount of triangles drawn each iteration. This was to supplement the content taught in their Sequences and Series unit as well as with their unit on Fractals.
